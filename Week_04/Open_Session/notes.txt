slot : Tells you where the content goes. 
props : Tells you where the attribute goes. 

In index.html we created two components 
-> First component with attributes and content
-> Second component with attributes and no content. 

Every template can have its own data properties, methods, computed properties. 

The useage of props and data properties in component or in the template is exactly same.

How do you provide data from parent element to child element ? 
-> using props

If we have to send data from parent to child -> using props 
But if we have to send data from child to parent -> using $emit

components can be siblings, no data transfer among themselves. 

If i created data property in the component it stays with the component. 
If you want to create a data property in the main application it stays with the main application.
